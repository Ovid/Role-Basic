Revision history for Role-Basic

The token "[!Moose]" documents features which diverge from Moose.

0.0801
        - Make sure people can run all of the tests, not just the top-level
        - Bugfix: -rename => { x => y, y => x } now works
        - Add a "philosophy" document.
        - Aliasing $old to $new should fulfill requirements for $new, if any

0.08    Jan 22, 2011
        - Methods which point to the same reference do not conflict (because
          they're the same method).
        - [!Moose] Excluded methods are now required. See
          [https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=45591] in Moose.
        - [!Moose] Added -rename, a combination of -alias and -excludes.
        - Add -version for roles
        - Bug fix: make sure that -alias doesn't also -exclude
        - Bug fix: Can't alias over an existing method
        - Removed a number of Moose tests which don't apply

0.0701  Jan 9, 2011
        - Bug fix: add t/lib to t/composition.t (Marcel Grünauer)

0.07    Jan 8, 2011
        - Fix problem where 'allowed' methods in one role weren't carried over
          into another. Reported by Marcel Grünauer. I really need to grab the
          Moose tests.
        - Documented the ALPHA nature of the code.

0.06    Jan 6, 2011
        - Allow roles to have getter/setter generators (Marcel Grünauer
          pointed this out).
        - Work around 5.6.x bug where ->can('can') was always returning true.
          Thanks to Ben Morrow for spotting the bug.

0.05    Jan 4, 2011
        - Remove Test::Most dependency. All deps are now core.

0.04    Jan 3, 2011
        - Ensure that multiple roles flattening in identical methods from same
          role don't cause conflicts (report by Marcel Grünauer)
        - List repository in Build.PL so that people people on CPAN can find
          the github version.

0.03    Jan 1, 2011
        - Bugfix: rename '-aliases' to '-alias' for Moose compatability.

0.02    Dec 29, 2010
        - Remove Carp::Always. Oops :)

0.01    Dec 28, 2010    
        - Minimal role support with a Moose-like syntax
